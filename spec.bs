# Introduction # {#intro}

*This section is non-normative.*

The Protected Audience API facilitates selecting an advertisement to display to a user based on a
previous interaction with the advertiser or advertising network.

When a user's interactions with an advertiser indicate an interest in something, the advertiser can
ask the browser to record this interest on-device by calling
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}. Later, when a website wants to select an
advertisement to show to the user, the website can call
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/runAdAuction()}} to ask the browser to conduct an
<dfn>auction</dfn> where each of these on-device recorded interests are given the chance to
calculate a bid to display their advertisement.


<h2 id="joining-interest-groups">Joining Interest Groups</h2>

*This first introductory paragraph is non-normative.*

When a user's interactions with a website indicate that the user may have a particular interest, an
advertiser or someone working on behalf of the advertiser (e.g. a demand side platform, DSP) can ask
the user's browser to record this interest on-device by calling
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}. This indicates an intent to display an
advertisement relevant to this interest to this user in the future. The [=user agent=] has an
<dfn>interest group set</dfn>, a [=list=] of [=interest groups=] in which
[=interest group/owner=] / [=interest group/name=] pairs are unique.

{{AuctionAdInterestGroup}} is used by {{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}, and
when an interest group is stored to [=interest group set=].
`priority` and `prioritySignalsOverrides` are not passed to `generateBid()` because they can be
modified by `generatedBid()` calls, so could theoretically be used to create a cross-site profile of
a user accessible to `generateBid()` methods, otherwise. `lifetimeMs` is not passed to `generateBid()`
because it's ambiguous what should be passed: the lifetime when the group was joined, or the
remaining lifetime. Providing the remaining lifetime would also potentially give access to more
granular timing information than the API would otherwise allow, when state is shared across interest
groups.

<h3 id="interest-group-storage-maintenance">Interest Group Storage Maintenance</h3>

There is a job that periodically [=performs storage maintenance=] on the [=user agent=]'s
[=interest group set=]. It performs operations such as [=list/removing=] expired or excess
[=interest groups=]. An [=interest group set=] must respect the following limits. Implementations
may define their own values for the below constants, however we supply the below values as a
starting point, inspired by what the initial implementation of this specification uses:
  * <dfn>Interest group set max owners</dfn> is 1000, which defines the max number of
    [=interest group/owners=] in the [=user agent=]'s [=interest group set=].
  * <dfn>Max regular interest groups per owner</dfn> is 2000, which defines the max number of
    [=regular interest groups=] in the [=user agent=]'s [=interest group set=] for an
    [=interest group/owner=].
  * <dfn>Max negative interest groups per owner</dfn> is 20000, which defines the max number of
    [=negative interest groups=] in the [=user agent=]'s [=interest group set=] for an
    [=interest group/owner=].
  * <dfn>Max interest groups total size per owner</dfn> is <code>10\*1024\*1024</code>, which
    defines the max total [=interest group/estimated size|sizes=] of [=interest groups=] in the
    [=user agent=]'s [=interest group set=] for an [=interest group/owner=]. It includes both
    [=regular interest groups=] and [=negative interest groups=].

<div algorithm>
To <dfn>perform storage maintenance</dfn>:

1. Let |ownersAndExpiry| be a new [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=origins=] and

The process of running an ad auction through {{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/runAdAuction()}} is an
expensive operation. To prevent wasted cycles if the resulting ad cannot be loaded in the current
context, {{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/canLoadAdAuctionFencedFrame()}} is provided as a method to
determine, before the ad auction begins, whether an ad auction-created <{fencedframe}> is allowed to
be loaded in the current context. A <{fencedframe}> has restrictions on where and how it can be

### Downsampling ### {#downsampling-header}

*This first introductory paragraph is non-normative.*

Implementations may define their own values for the below constants based on their privacy goal,
however we supply the below values as a starting point, inspired by what the initial implementation
of this specification uses:
  * <dfn>sampling rate</dfn> is 1/1000, which means only sending reports 1/1000 times the
    {{InterestGroupBiddingAndScoringScriptRunnerGlobalScope/forDebuggingOnly}} API is called.
  * <dfn>lockout period</dfn> is 3 years.
  * <dfn>long cooldown rate</dfn> is 1/10, which means 10% of the time putting an adtech in a long
    cooldown period if the adtech calls the API.
  * <dfn>long cooldown period</dfn> is 1 year.
  * <dfn>short cooldown period</dfn> is 2 weeks.

Note: More details of how these numbers are determined can be found in comments here:
(<a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/632">WICG/turtledove#632</a>).

The design of downsampling [=forDebuggingOnly reports=] has three main goals:
* Prevent sending debug reports very often to protect user privacy:
  * Only sending debug reports [=sampling rate=] times the forDebuggingOnly API is called;
  * if a report is sent, "lock-out" all adtechs out of sending a report for [=lockout period=];
  * if an adtech calls the API, put them in a "cool-down" period where calls to the API by that
    given adtech are not able to send reports.
* Prevent one adtech from substantially compromising a different adtech's access to debugging
  information. The "cool-down" period means that any particular adtech can only cause a very small
  fraction of people to send debug reports and be removed from the potential debugging pool.
* Prevent adtechs who accidentally (e.g. due to a bug in their code) call the API repeatedly for all
  users, from locking themselves out of sending any more reports for years. This is accomplished by
  only [=long cooldown rate=] of the time putting that adtech in a [=long cooldown period=], and
  rest of the time putting that adtech in a [=short cooldown period=].

The [=user agent=] has a <dfn>debug report lockout until</dfn>, which is null or a [=moment=], and
a <dfn>debug report cooldown</dfn>, which is null or a [=map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=origins=]
and [=map/values=] are [=moments=] at which the cool down for the origin key expires.

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>is debugging only in cooldown or lockout</dfn> given an [=origin=] |origin|:

  1. If [=user agent=]'s [=debug report lockout until=] is not null, and [=current wall time=] is
    less than [=user agent=]'s [=debug report lockout until=], return true.
  1. If [=user agent=]'s [=debug report cooldown=] is null, then return false.
  1. If [=user agent=]'s [=debug report cooldown=][|origin|] [=map/exists=] and [=current wall time=]
    is less than [=user agent=]'s [=debug report cooldown=][|origin|], then return true.
  1. Return false.
</div>

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>sample a debug report</dfn> given an [=origin=] |origin|:

  1. Let |canSendAfterSampled| be false.
  1. Let |sampleRand| be a random {{long}}, 0 &le; |sampleRand| &lt; 1000, so each possible long would be
    chosen with a probability equal to [=sampling rate=].
  1. If |sampleRand| is 0:
    1. Set |canSendAfterSampled| to true.
    1. Set [=user agent=]'s [=debug report lockout until=] to [=current wall time=] plus
      [=lockout period=].
  1. Let |cooldownRand| be a random {{long}} &ge; 0 and &lt; 10, which corresponds to

    [=long cooldown rate=].
  1. Let |cooldownPeriod| be [=long cooldown period=] if |cooldownRand| is 0,
    [=short cooldown period=] otherwise.
  1. Set [=user agent=]'s [=debug report cooldown=][|origin|] to [=current wall time=] plus
    |cooldownPeriod|.
  1. Return |canSendAfterSampled|.

## {{InterestGroupBiddingAndScoringScriptRunnerGlobalScope/realTimeReporting}} ## {#real-time-reporting-header}

*This first introductory paragraph is non-normative.*

The goal of real-time reporting is to get auction monitoring data to the buyer and seller as quickly
as possible (e.g. &lt; 5 mins). The primary use-case is rapid error detection i.e. detecting quickly
whether there are major problems with unexpected behavior in `generateBid()`, `scoreAd()`, or
fetching of bidding or scoring scripts or trusted signals.

Initial implementation of this specification defines
  * <dfn>number of user buckets</dfn> is 1024, which means buckets 0 to 1023 are supported by
    {{InterestGroupBiddingAndScoringScriptRunnerGlobalScope/realTimeReporting}} API.
  * <dfn>number of platform buckets</dfn> is 4, which are buckets for errors that are not visible in
    either `scoreAd()` or `generateBid()`.

<div id="real-time-report-example" class=example>
  <p> Each real time report is a [[RFC8949|CBOR]] message using the following data structure:</p>
  <pre highlight="js">
  {
    "version": 1,
    "histogram": {
      "buckets": [5, 32, 0, 1, ..., 129],  // 128 elements.
      "length": 1024    // 1024 buckets before bit packing.
    },
    "platformHistogram": {
      "buckets": [192],
      "length": 4  // 4 buckets before bit packing.
    }
  }
  </pre>

### Platform contribution ### {#platform-contribution-header}

*This first introductory paragraph is non-normative.*

There are some errors not visible in either `scoreAd()` or `generateBid()`, like failures to fetch
the bidding or scoring script, trusted bidding or scoring signals. Certain buckets are used for
these errors.

[=number of user buckets=]:
* <dfn>bidding script failure bucket</dfn>: [=number of user buckets=]
* <dfn>scoring script failure bucket</dfn>: [=number of user buckets=] plus 1
* <dfn>trusted bidding signals failure bucket</dfn>: [=number of user buckets=] plus 2

## Additional Bids ## {#additional-bids-section}

*This first introductory paragraph is non-normative.*

In addition to [=generate potentially multiple bids|bids generated by interest groups=], sellers can enable buyers to
introduce bids generated outside of the auction, which are called <dfn>additional bids</dfn>.
[=Additional bids=] are commonly triggered using contextual signals. Buyers compute the
[=additional bids=], likely as part of a contextual auction. Buyers need to package up each
[=additional bid=] using a new data structure that encapsulates all of the information needed for
the [=additional bid=] to compete against other bids in a Protected Audience [=auction=].

<div id="additional-bid-example" class=example>
  <p> Each additional bid is expressed using the following JSON data structure:</p>
  <pre highlight="js">

## Negative Targeting ## {#negative-targeting-section}

*This first introductory paragraph is non-normative.*

In online ad auctions for ad space, it’s sometimes useful to prevent showing an ad to certain
audiences, a concept known as <dfn>negative targeting</dfn>. To facilitate [=negative targeting=] in
Protected Audience [=auctions=], each [=additional bid=] is allowed to identify one or more
[=negative interest groups=]. If the user has been joined to any of the identified
[=negative interest groups=], the [=additional bid=] is dropped; otherwise it participates in the
[=auction=], competing alongside bids created by calls to `generateBid()`. An [=additional bid=]
that specifies no [=negative interest groups=] is always accepted into the [=auction=].

<div algorithm>
To <dfn>check whether negative targeted</dfn> given an [=decoded additional bid=] |additionalBid|, a
[=set=] of [=byte sequences=] |verifiedSignatureKeys|, and a [=negative target info=]
|negativeTargetInfo|:

  1. [=Assert=] that these steps are running [=in parallel=].
  1. Let |negativeTargeted| be false.
  1. Let |additionalBidBuyer| be |additionalBid|'s [=decoded additional bid/bid=]'s
    [=generated bid/interest group=]'s [=interest group/owner=].
  1. [=list/For each=] |igName| of |additionalBid|'s
    [=decoded additional bid/negative target interest group names=]:
    1. If |negativeTargetInfo|[(|additionalBidBuyer|, |igName|)] [=map/exists=]:
      1. Let (|joiningOrigin|, |additionalBidKey|) be
        |negativeTargetInfo|[(|additionalBidBuyer|, |igName|)].
      1. If |verifiedSignatureKeys| [=list/contains=] |additionalBidKey|:
        1. If |joiningOrigin| is not null:
          1. If |joiningOrigin| is not [=same origin=] with |additionalBid|'s
            [=decoded additional bid/negative target joining origin=], then [=iteration/continue=].
        1. Set |negativeTargeted| to true, and [=iteration/break=].

   Note: If the signature doesn't verify successfully, the [=additional bid=] proceeds as if the
      [=negative interest group=] is not present. This ensures that only the
      [=interest group/owner=] of the [=negative interest group=], who created the
      {{AuctionAdInterestGroup/additionalBidKey}}, is allowed to
      [=negative targeting|negatively target=] the interest group, and that nobody else can learn
      whether the [=interest group set=] [=list/contains=] the interest group.
  1. Return |negativeTargeted|.
</div>

A <dfn>negative target info</dfn> is a [=map=]. Its [=map/keys=] are [=tuples=] consisting of an
[=origin=] for [=interest group/owner=] and a [=string=] for [=interest group/name=].
Its [=map/values=] are [=tuples=] consisting of an [=origin=] for [=interest group/joining origin=]
and a [=byte sequence=] for [=interest group/additional bid key=].

### Negative Interest Groups ### {#negative-interest-groups}

*This section is non-normative.*

Though [=negative interest groups=] are joined using the same {{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}
API as [=regular interest groups=], they remain distinct from one another. Only
[=negative interest groups=]'s [=interest group/additional bid key=] can be non-null, while only
[=regular interest groups=]'s [=interest group/ads=] can be non-null. Because the subset of fields
used by a [=negative interest group=] cannot be meaningfully updated, a [=negative interest group=]'s
[=interest group/update url=] must be null, otherwise a {{TypeError}} will be [=exception/thrown=] by
{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}} API.

[=Additional bids=] specify the [=negative interest groups=] they're [=negatively targeting=]
against using at most one of the following two fields in their JSON data structure:
  * negativeInterestGroup, for a single negative interest group;
  * negativeInterestGroups, for more than one negative interest groups.

If an [=additional bid=] needs to specify more than one [=negative interest groups=], all of those
[=negative interest groups=] must be joined from the [=same origin=], and that [=origin=] must be
identified ahead of time in the [=additional bid=]'s `joiningOrigin` field. Any
[=negative interest group=] that wasn't joined from that identified [=origin=] is ignored for
[=negative targeting=].

  <pre highlight="js">
  const additionalBid = {
    ...

# K-anonymity # {#k-anonymity}

Two goals of this specification rely on applying [=k-anonymity=] thresholds:

  * To prevent cross-site leaks:  Inputs to event-level reporting functions, `reportWin()` and
    `reportResult()`, only contain limited cross-site information. As described in
    [[#privacy-considerations]], part of this limiting is done by
    applying [=k-anonymity=] requirements to the ad URLs.
  * To ensure that the same ad or ad component is being shown to at least some minimum number of people:
    The browser applies [=k-anonymity=] requirements on the ad URLs.

The browser enforces these [=k-anonymity=] requirements by maintaining counts of how many times each
ad and ad component has been shown to users. These counts are maintained across users, so the counting must
be done on a central <dfn>k-anonymity server</dfn>. This specification relies on two operations to query and
increment the counts: [=query k-anonymity count=] and [=increment k-anonymity count=].

The details of how the [=k-anonymity server=] is operated and accessed are [=implementation-defined=]
but it should be done in a way that prevents the server operator from joining the identity of two
query or increment requests. One way to help prevent this is by making accesses to the server go
through an HTTP proxy that prevents the server from seeing the browsers' IP addresses.

The browser should choose a <dfn>k-anonymity threshold</dfn>, otherwise known as the value for "k",
and a <dfn>k-anonymity duration</dfn> depending
on the projected sizes of interest groups and the browser's privacy goals. For example an implementation
might choose to require a [=k-anonymity=] threshold of fifty users over a seven day period. The server
will maintain the count over the chosen duration and compare the count to the chosen [=k-anonymity=]
threshold when responding to [=query k-anonymity count=].

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>query k-anonymity count</dfn> given a |hashCode|:
    1. If the [=k-anonymity server=] has recorded at least [=k-anonymity threshold=] users
        seeing |hashCode| over the last [=k-anonymity duration=], return true.
        Otherwise return false.
    1. Return true if it is above the threshold, otherwise return false.
</div>

# Script Runners # {#script-runners}

*This introduction sub-section is non-normative*.

This specification defines a new type of script execution environment called a [=script runner=]. On
the surface, these are similar to <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C#worklets-intro>Worklets</a>
in that they too are used for running scripts independent of the *main* execution environment with a
flexible implementation model.

However, some key differences from traditional Worklets motivate us to create a new kind of script
execution environment. In particular, they:

 * Are not scoped to a particular {{Document}}, but are rather scoped to a [=user agent=], as they
   are spun up by [=interest groups=] in the [=user agent=]'s [=interest group set=].
 * Consequently have a different, more flexible [=ECMAScript/agent cluster=] allocation model —
   specifically, they need not execute in the same [=ECMAScript/agent cluster=] as any {{Document}},
   and for privacy reasons implementations may be motivated to enjoy this flexibility.
 * Do not have any other WebIDL interfaces exposed to their global besides the ones defined in this
   specification, unlike other Worklet types.
 * Have a restricted set of ECMAScript APIs exposed to them; for example {{Date}} is not exposed in
   these environments.
 * Are not [=module scripts=], and are instead evaluated as if they were [=classic scripts=].
 * Are not [=scripts=] in the [[HTML]] sense, and as such:
   * Their [=ECMAScript/agent=] does not have an [=event loop=]
   * Their [=ECMAScript/realm=] does not have a [=realm/settings object=], and therefore functions
     inside them are not run with the familiar [[WebIDL]] [=invoke|invocation=] mechanism.
   * They do not [=perform a microtask checkpoints=].

## Realm and agent ## {#realm-and-agent}

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>create a new script runner agent</dfn>, run these steps:

    1. Let |signifier| be a new unique internal value.

    1. Let |candidateExecution| be a new [=ECMAScript/candidate execution=].

    1. Return a new [=ECMAScript/agent=] whose \[[CanBlock]] is false, \[[Signifier]] is
       |signifier|, \[[CandidateExecution]] is |candidateExecution|, and \[[IsLockFree1]],
       \[[IsLockFree2]], and \[[LittleEndian]] are set at the implementation's discretion.

  Note: This algorithm is almost identical to [[HTML]]'s [=create an agent=] algorithm, with the
  exception that we do not give the returned agent a new [=event loop=], since it does not process
  [=tasks=] within [=task sources=] in the usual way.
</div>

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>obtain a script runner agent</dfn>, run these steps:

    1. Let |agentCluster| be a new [=ECMAScript/agent cluster=].

    1. Let |agent| be the result of [=creating a new script runner agent=].

    1. Add |agent| to |agentCluster|.

    1. Return |agent|.
</div>

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>create a new script runner realm</dfn> with a global type |globalType|, run these steps:

    1. [=Assert=] that these steps are running [=in parallel=].

    1. Let |agent| be the result of [=obtaining a script runner agent=] given null, true, and false.
      Run the rest of these steps in |agent|.

       Issue: This exclusively creates a new [=ECMAScript/agent cluster=] for a given script to run
       in, but we should make this work with [=interest group/execution mode=] somehow.

    1. Let |realmExecutionContext| be the result of [=creating a new realm=] given |agent| and the
       following customizations:

        * For the global object, create a new object of type |globalType|.

    1. Let |realm| be |realmExecutionContext|'s Realm component.

    1. Let |global| be |realm|'s [=realm/global object=], and run these steps:

      1. Perform !|global|.\[[Delete]]("`Date`").

      1. If !|global|.\[[HasProperty]]("`Temporal`") is true, then perform
         !|global|.\[[Delete]]("`Temporal`").

      Advisement: This is not the best way to perform such API neutering (see
      <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/1357#issuecomment-817560121">tc39/ecma262#1357</a>),
      but at the moment it's the way that host environments do this.

      Note: Removing time-referencing APIs from the |global| object is imperative for privacy, as a
      script might otherwise be able to more easily exfiltrate data by using more accurate time
      measurements.

    1. Return |realm|.

</dl>

A <dfn>regular interest group</dfn> is an [=interest group=] whose
[=interest group/additional bid key=] is null.

A <dfn>negative interest group</dfn> is an [=interest group=] whose
[=interest group/additional bid key=] is not null.

An <dfn>interest group ad</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following [=struct/items=]:

<dl dfn-for="interest group ad">
  : <dfn>render url</dfn>
  :: A [=URL=]. If this ad wins the auction, this URL (or a [=urn uuid=] that maps to this URL) will

  : <dfn>metadata</dfn>
  :: Null or a [=string=]. Extra arbitary information about this ad, passed to `generateBid()`.
  : <dfn>buyer reporting ID</dfn>
  :: Null or a [=string=]. Will be passed in place of interest group name to [=report win=], subject

    [=interest group/ad components=].
  : <dfn>buyer and seller reporting ID</dfn>
  :: Null or a [=string=]. Will be passed in place of interest group name or
    [=interest group ad/buyer reporting ID=] to [=report win=] and [=report result=], subject to
    [=k-anonymity=] checks. Only meaningful in [=interest group/ads=], but ignored in

  : <dfn>allowed reporting origins</dfn>
  :: Null or a [=list=] of [=origins=]. A list of up to 10 reporting origins that can receive reports
    with registered macros. Each origin's [=origin/scheme=] must be "`https`" and each origin must be
    <a href="https://github.com/privacysandbox/attestation">enrolled</a>. Only meaningful in
    [=interest group/ads=], but ignored in [=interest group/ad components=].
</dl>

A <dfn>previous win</dfn> is the [=interest group=]'s auction win history, to allow on-device
frequency capping. It's a [=struct=] with the following [=struct/items=]:

[=byte sequence=]. The 4-byte [=byte sequence=] can store no more than 32 capabilities.

Note: More than 2 values, but probably not more than 32 values are planned, at least for a while.
This way, there is not need to reserve more space for a while.

<h3 dfn-type=dfn>Currency tag</h3>
A currency tag is a [=string=] containing exactly 3 upper-case ASCII letters, or null. The null

      [=auction config/seller=].
    </p>
  : <dfn>trusted scoring signals url</dfn>
  :: Null or a [=URL=].
    Provide a mechanism for making real-time data (information about a specific [=ad creative=])
    available for use at [=evaluate a scoring script|scoring=] time, e.g. the results of some ad
    scanning system.
  : <dfn>max trusted scoring signals url length</dfn>
  :: A {{long}} integer, initially 0. Indicates the maximum trusted scoring signals fetch url length
    for the auction config. 0 means no limit.
  : <dfn>interest group buyers</dfn>
  :: Null or a [=list=] of [=origins=].
    Owners of interest groups allowed to participate in the auction. Each [=origin's=]
    [=origin/scheme=] must be "`https`".
  : <dfn>auction signals</dfn>
  :: Null, a [=string=], a {{Promise}}, or failure.
    Opaque JSON data passed to both sellers' and buyers' [=script runners=].
  : <dfn>requested size</dfn>
  :: Null or an [=ad size=], initially null.
    The size of the frame for the ad being selected by the auction.
  : <dfn>all slots requested sizes</dfn>
  :: Null or a non-[=set/empty=] [=ordered set=] of [=ad sizes=], initially null.
    The sizes of all frames for ads being selected by any auction in the frame.
  : <dfn>seller signals</dfn>
  :: Null, a [=string=], a {{Promise}}, or failure.
    Opaque JSON data passed to the seller's [=script runner=].
  : <dfn>seller timeout</dfn>
  :: A [=duration=] in milliseconds, initially 50 milliseconds.
    Restricts the runtime of the seller's `scoreAd()` script. If scoring does not complete before
    the timeout, the bid being scored is not considered further.
  : <dfn>per buyer signals</dfn>
  :: Null, a {{Promise}}, failure, or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=origins=] and
    whose [=map/values=] are [=strings=].
    [=map/Keys=] are buyers whose [=origin/schemes=] must be "`https`". [=map/Values=] are
    opaque JSON data passed to corresponding buyer's [=script runner=].
  : <dfn>per buyer timeouts</dfn>
  :: Null, a {{Promise}}, failure, or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=origins=] and
    whose [=map/values=] are [=durations=] in milliseconds.
    [=map/Keys=] are buyers whose [=origin/schemes=] must be "`https`". [=map/Values=] restrict the
    runtime of corresponding buyer's `generateBid()` script. If the timeout expires, only the bid
    submitted via `setBid()` is considered.
  : <dfn>all buyers timeout</dfn>
  :: A [=duration=] in milliseconds, initially 50 milliseconds.
    Restricts the `generateBid()` script's runtime for all buyers without a timeout specified in
    [=auction config/per buyer timeouts=]. If the timeout expires, only the bid submitted via
    `setBid()` is considered.
  : <dfn>per buyer cumulative timeouts</dfn>
  :: Null, a {{Promise}}, failure, or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=origins=] and
    whose [=map/values=] are [=durations=] in milliseconds.
    [=map/Keys=] are buyers whose [=origin/schemes=] must be "`https`". [=map/Values=] are collective
    timeouts for all interest groups of the buyer represented by the [=map/key=]. Includes the time of
    loading scripts and signals, and running the `generateBid()` functions. Once the timer expires,
    the affected buyer's interest groups may no longer generate any bids. All bids generated before
    the timeout will continue to participate in the auction.
    Implementations should attempt, on a best-effort basis, to generate bids for each buyer in
    priority order, so lower priority [=interest groups=] are the ones more likely to be timed out. If
    {{Promise}}s are passed in to the [=auction config=] for fields that support them,
    [=wait until configuration input promises resolve=] before starting the timer.
  : <dfn>all buyers cumulative timeout</dfn>
  :: Null or a [=duration=] in milliseconds, initially null.

    [=auction config/per buyer cumulative timeouts=].
  : <dfn>per buyer group limits</dfn>
  :: Null or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=origins=] and whose [=map/values=] are
    {{unsigned short}}s.
    [=map/Keys=] are buyers whose [=origin/schemes=] must be "`https`". [=map/Values=] restrict the
    number of bidding interest groups for a particular buyer that can participate in an auction.
  : <dfn>all buyers group limit</dfn>
  :: An {{unsigned short}}, initially 65535.
    Limit on the number of bidding interest groups for all buyers without a limit specified in
    [=auction config/per buyer group limits=].
  : <dfn>per buyer priority signals</dfn>
  :: Null or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=origins=] and whose [=map/values=] are
    [=ordered maps=], whose [=map/keys=] are [=strings=] and whose [=map/values=] are {{double}}.
    Per-buyer sparse vector whose dot product with [=interest group/priority vector=] is used to
    calculate interest group priorities. No signal's key starts with "browserSignals.", which is
    reserved for values coming from the browser.
  : <dfn>all buyers priority signals</dfn>
  :: Null or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=strings=] and whose [=map/values=] are
    {{double}}.
    Merged with [=auction config/per buyer priority signals=] before calculating per-interest group
    priorities. In the case both have entries with the same key, the entry in
    `per_buyer_priority_signals` takes precedence. No signals key start with "browserSignals.", which
    is reserved for values coming from the browser.
  : <dfn>required seller capabilities</dfn>
  :: A [=set=] of [=seller capabilities=].
    The [=seller capabilities=] that each [=interest group=] must declare to participate in the
    auction. Interest groups that don't declare all these capabilities will not participate in the
    auction.
  : <dfn>component auctions</dfn>
  :: A [=list=] of [=auction config=]s.
    Nested auctions whose results will also participate in a top level auction. Only the top level
    [=auction config=] can have component auctions.

# Privacy Considerations # {#privacy-considerations}

Protected Audience aims to advance the privacy of remarketing and custom audience
advertising on the web, so naturally privacy considerations are paramount to Protected Audience’s
design.  Partitioning data by site is the central mechanism to prevent joining a user’s identity
across sites:
- Interest group definitions come from just one site, the site that called
  {{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}.
- Bidding (`generateBid()`) and scoring (`scoreAd()`) scripts are exposed to interest group data
  from the joining site, and data from the site that will display the ad, but these scripts are run
  in strict isolation to prevent leaking this cross-site information.
- The browser can enforce that trusted bidding and scoring signals are fetched from servers
  complying with certain privacy requirements, e.g. not performing event-level logging.
- Ads are rendered in <{fencedframe}>s that isolate them from the surrounding page to prevent
  cross-site leakage.
- Reporting is strictly controlled by the browser to prevent cross-site leaks:  Inputs to
  event-level reporting functions, `reportWin()` and `reportResult()`, only contain limited
  cross-site information, e.g. the k-anonymous ad URL.  Event-level reporting is meant to be a
  temporary stepping stone to more private mechanisms like [Private Aggregation
  API](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api).
- If [[#interest-group-updates]] are allowed to run after navigating to another page, the source IP
  address used for those requests can continue to reveal coarse location information about the
  device. Implementations may wish to implement some form of IP privacy, like a proxy, or limit how
  long updates can run post-navigation.


# Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

Protected Audience involves the browser running untrusted JavaScript downloaded from multiple
parties, so security concerns are top of mind. Fortunately Protected Audience is a highly
constrained API not attempting to be a general purpose execution environment. Execution of this
JavaScript is controlled and limited as follows:
- Protected Audience requires the origin of the scripts’ URLs to match that of the origin of the
  interest group owner, which is in turn required to match the origin of the context calling the
  {{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}.
- URL schemes are required to be HTTPS.
- Redirects are disallowed.
- Responses are required to contain the `Ad-Auction-Allowed: ?1` header.
- Fetches are uncredentialed.

Protected Audience has the browser pass in several “browserSignals” to the bidding script that give
the script unforgeable information about the context that the script is being executed in. This way
bidders and sellers have the choice to only participate in auctions where they are comfortable
working with the involved parties.

The [execution environment](#script-runners) available to these scripts is the absolute minimum
necessary to calculate a bid. It supports only ECMAScript. It does not support network, storage,
timer, date, DOM, Workers, postMessage, Navigator or Window APIs.

Protected Audience adds Permission-Policies to control access to the Protected Audience APIs to
give sites and embedders the ability to clamp down on use of the APIs as they see fit.

Auction config and interest group data are processed as JSON and not via the [=structured clone
algorithm=], in part because interest groups are updated via JSON server responses. However, there
is also a security reason to not use the structured clone algorithm, which is that the data may
be shared with other parties -- in particular, the auction config
{{AuctionAdConfig/perBuyerSignals}} are sent from the seller to each buyer. Supporting structured
cloning here would mean that buyer scripts would have to be prepared to handle arbitrary, complex,
and potentially cyclic objects from the seller.
