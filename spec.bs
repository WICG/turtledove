# Introduction # {#intro}

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

The Protected Audience API facilitates selecting an advertisement to display to a user based on a
previous interaction with the advertiser or advertising network.

When a user's interactions with an advertiser indicate an interest in something, the advertiser can
ask the browser to record this interest on-device by calling
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}. Later, when a website wants to select an
advertisement to show to the user, the website can call
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/runAdAuction()}} to ask the browser to conduct an auction where
each of these on-device recorded interests are given the chance to calculate a bid to display their
advertisement.


<h2 id="joining-interest-groups">Joining Interest Groups</h2>

When a user's interactions with a website indicate that the user may have a particular interest, an
advertiser or someone working on behalf of the advertiser (e.g. a demand side platform, DSP) can ask
the user's browser to record this interest on-device by calling
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}. This indicates an intent to display an
advertisement relevant to this interest to this user in the future. The user agent has an
<dfn>interest group set</dfn>, a [=list=] of [=interest groups=] in which
[=interest group/owner=] / [=interest group/name=] pairs are unique.

partial interface Navigator {
  Promise<undefined> joinAdInterestGroup(AuctionAdInterestGroup group);
};

dictionary AuctionAd {
  required USVString renderURL;
  any metadata;
};

dictionary GenerateBidInterestGroup {
  required USVString owner;
  required USVString name;
  required double lifetimeMs;

  boolean enableBiddingSignalsPrioritization = false;
  record<DOMString, double> priorityVector;

  DOMString executionMode = "compatibility";

  sequence<AuctionAd> adComponents;
};

dictionary AuctionAdInterestGroup : GenerateBidInterestGroup {
  double priority = 0.0;
  record<DOMString, double> prioritySignalsOverrides;
};
</xmp>

{{AuctionAdInterestGroup}} is used by {{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}, and
when an interest group is stored to [=interest group set=].
`priority` and `prioritySignalsOverrides` are not passed to `generateBid()` because they can be
modified by `generatedBid()` calls, so could theoretically be used to create a cross-site profile of
a user accessible to `generateBid()` methods, otherwise.

Two goals of this specification rely on applying k-anonymity thresholds:

    [[#privacy-considerations]], part of this limiting is done by
    applying k-anonymity requirements to the ad URLs.
  * To prevent microtargeting:  The browser applies k-anonymity requirements on the ad URLs to
    ensure that the same ad or ad component is being shown to at least some minimum number of
    people.

The browser enforces these k-anonymity requirements by maintaining counts of how many times each
ad and ad component has been shown to users. These counts are maintained across users, so the counting must
be done on a central <dfn>k-anonymity server</dfn>. This specification relies on two operations to query and
increment the counts: [=query k-anonymity count=] and [=increment k-anonymity count=].
  
The details of how the [=k-anonymity server=] is operated and accessed are [=implementation-defined=]
but it should be done in a way that prevents the server operator from joining the identity of two
query or increment requests. One way to help prevent this is by making accesses to the server go
through an HTTP proxy that prevents the server from seeing the browsers' IP addresses.

The browser should choose a <dfn>k-anonymity threshold</dfn>, otherwise known as the value for "k", 
and a <dfn>k-anonymity duration</dfn> depending
on the projected sizes of interest groups and the browser's privacy goals. For example an implementation
might choose to require a k-anonymity threshold of fifty users over a seven day period. The server
will maintain the count over the chosen duration and compare the count to the chosen k-anonymity
threshold when responding to [=query k-anonymity count=].

    1. If the [=k-anonymity server=] has recorded at least [=k-anonymity threshold=] users

# Script Runners # {#script-runners}

*This introduction sub-section is non-normative*.

This specification defines a new type of script execution environment called a [=script runner=]. On
the surface, these are similar to <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C#worklets-intro>Worklets</a>
in that they too are used for running scripts independent of the *main* execution environment with a
flexible implementation model.

However, some key differences from traditional Worklets motivate us to create a new kind of script
execution environment. In particular, they:

 * Are not scoped to a particular {{Document}}, but are rather scoped to a user agent, as they are
   spun up by [=interest groups=] in the user agent's [=interest group set=].
 * Consequently have a different, more flexible [=ECMAScript/agent cluster=] allocation model —
   specifically, they need not execute in the same [=ECMAScript/agent cluster=] as any {{Document}},
   and for privacy reasons implementations may be motivated to enjoy this flexibility.
 * Do not have any other WebIDL interfaces exposed to their global besides the ones defined in this
   specification, unlike other Worklet types.
 * Have a restricted set of ECMAScript APIs exposed to them; for example {{Date}} is not exposed in
   these environments.
 * Are not [=module scripts=], and are instead evaluated as if they were [=classic scripts=].
 * Are not [=scripts=] in the [[HTML]] sense, and as such:
   * Their [=ECMAScript/agent=] does not have an [=event loop=]
   * Their [=ECMAScript/realm=] does not have a [=realm/settings object=], and therefore functions
     inside them are not run with the familiar [[WebIDL]] [=invoke|invocation=] mechanism.
   * They do not [=perform a microtask checkpoints=].

## Script evaluation ## {#script-evaluation}

Concretely, a <dfn>script runner</dfn> is a JavaScript execution environment instantiated with one
of the following global objects:

 * {{InterestGroupBiddingScriptRunnerGlobalScope}}
 * {{InterestGroupScoringScriptRunnerGlobalScope}}
 * {{InterestGroupReportingScriptRunnerGlobalScope}}

    1. Let |duration| be the [=current wall time=] minus |startTime| in milliseconds.
    1. If |global|'s [=InterestGroupBiddingScriptRunnerGlobalScope/priority=] is not null:
      1. Set |ig|'s [=interest group/priority=] to |global|'s
        [=InterestGroupBiddingScriptRunnerGlobalScope/priority=].
      1. [=list/Replace=] the [=interest group=] that has |ig|'s [=interest group/owner=] and [=interest group/name=] in the browser’s [=interest group set=] with |ig|.

      1. [=list/Replace=] the [=interest group=] that has |ig|'s [=interest group/owner=] and [=interest group/name=] in the browser’s [=interest group set=] with |ig|.

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>create a new script runner agent</dfn>, run these steps:

    1. Let |signifier| be a new unique internal value.

    1. Let |candidateExecution| be a new [=ECMAScript/candidate execution=].

    1. Return a new [=ECMAScript/agent=] whose \[[CanBlock]] is false, \[[Signifier]] is
       |signifier|, \[[CandidateExecution]] is |candidateExecution|, and \[[IsLockFree1]],
       \[[IsLockFree2]], and \[[LittleEndian]] are set at the implementation's discretion.

  Note: This algorithm is almost identical to [[HTML]]'s [=create an agent=] algorithm, with the
  exception that we do not give 
  the returned agent a new [=event loop=], since it does not process
  [=tasks=] within [=task sources=] in the usual way.

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>obtain a script runner agent</dfn>, run these steps:

  To <dfn>evaluate a script</dfn> with a [=realm/global object=] |global|, [=string=] |script|, [=string=]
  |functionName|, a [=list=] |arguments|, and an integer millisecond duration |timeout|, run these steps.
  They return a [=ECMAScript/Completion Record=], which is either an [=ECMAScript/abrupt completion=] (in
  the case of a parse failure or execution error), or a [=ECMAScript/normal completion=] populated with the
  [=ECMAScript/ECMAScript language value=] result of invoking |functionName|.

    1. [=Assert=] that these steps are running [=in parallel=].

    1. Let |agent| be the result of [=obtaining a script runner agent=] given null, true, and
       false. Run the rest of these steps in |agent|.

       Issue: This exclusively creates a new [=ECMAScript/agent cluster=] for the given |script| to
       run in, but we should make this work with [=interest group/execution mode=] somehow.

    1. Let |realmExecutionContext| be the result of [=creating a new realm=] given |agent| and the
       following customizations:

        * For the global object, use |global|.

    1. Let |realm| be |realmExecutionContext|'s Realm component.

    1. Let |global| be |realm|'s [=realm/global object=], and run these steps:

      1. Perform !|global|.\[[Delete]]("`Date`").

      1. If !|global|.\[[HasProperty]]("`Temporal`") is true, then perform
         !|global|.\[[Delete]]("`Temporal`").

      Advisement: This is not the best way to perform such API neutering (see <a
      href=https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/1357#issuecomment-817560121>tc39/ecma262#1357</a>),
      but at the moment it's the way that host environments do this.

      Note: Removing time-referencing APIs from the |global| object is imperative for privacy, as
      |script| might otherwise be able to more easily exfiltrate data by using more accurate time
      measurements.

    1. Let |result| be [$ParseScript$](|script|, |realm|, `empty`).

       Note: The resulting [=ECMAScript/Script Record=] will have no \[[HostDefined]] component,
       unlike traditional [=scripts=] on the web platform.

    1. If |result| is a list of errors, return
       Completion { \[[Type]]: `throw`, \[[Value]]: |result|, \[[Target]]: `empty` }.

    1. [=Assert=]: |result| is a [=ECMAScript/Script Record=].

    1. *Prepare to run script*: Push |realmExecutionContext| onto the [=ECMAScript/execution context
       stack|JavaScript execution context stack=]; it is now the [=ECMAScript/running execution
       context|running JavaScript execution context=].

    1. Let |evaluationStatus| be the result of [$ScriptEvaluation$](result).

    1. If |evaluationStatus| is an [=ECMAScript/abrupt completion=], jump to the step labeled <i><a
       href=#evaluate-script-return>return</a></i>.

    1. Let |F| be [$Get$](|global|, |functionName|). If that returns a [=ECMAScript/throw completion=],
       set |finalCompletion| to |F| and jump to the step labeled <i><a
       href=#evaluate-script-return>return</a></i>.

    1. Set |finalCompletion| be [=ECMAScript/Completion Record|Completion=]([$Call$](F, `undefined`,
       |arguments|)).
       
       In |timeout| milliseconds, if the invocation of [$Call$] has not completed,
       [=immediately=] interrupt the execution and set |finalCompletion| to a new
       [=ECMAScript/throw completion=] given null.

    1. <i id=evaluate-script-return>Return</i>: at this point |finalCompletion| will be set to a

      1. *Clean up after script*: [=Assert=] |realmExecutionContext| is the [=ECMAScript/running

is that they must not expose any interfaces from other specifications whose own exposure set is the
special value "*". The only interfaces that can be exposed inside of the globals defined in this
specification are those that explicitly list the global names provided here.

# Privacy Considerations # {#privacy-considerations}

Protected Audience aims to advance the privacy of remarketing and custom audience
advertising on the web, so naturally privacy considerations are paramount to Protected Audience’s
design.  Partitioning data by site is the central mechanism to prevent joining a user’s identity
across sites:
- Interest group definitions come from just one site, the site that called
  {{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}.
- Bidding (`generateBid()`) and scoring (`scoreAd()`) scripts are exposed to interest group data
  from the joining site, and data from the site that will display the ad, but these scripts are run
  in strict isolation to prevent leaking this cross-site information.
- The browser can enforce that trusted bidding and scoring signals are fetched from servers
  complying with certain privacy requirements, e.g. not performing event-level logging.
- Ads are rendered in <{fencedframe}>s that isolate them from the surrounding page to prevent
  cross-site leakage.
- Reporting is strictly controlled by the browser to prevent cross-site leaks:  Inputs to
  event-level reporting functions, `reportWin()` and `reportResult()`, only contain limited
  cross-site information, e.g. the k-anonymous ad URL.  Event-level reporting is meant to be a
  temporary stepping stone to more private mechanisms like [Private Aggregation
  API](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api).


# Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

Protected Audience involves the browser running untrusted JavaScript downloaded from multiple
parties, so security concerns are top of mind. Fortunately Protected Audience is a highly
constrained API not attempting to be a general purpose execution environment. Execution of this
JavaScript is controlled and limited as follows:
- Protected Audience requires the origin of the scripts’ URLs to match that of the origin of the
  interest group owner, which is in turn required to match the origin of the context calling the
  {{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}.
- URL schemes are required to be HTTPS.
- Redirects are disallowed.
- Responses are required to contain the `X-Allow-Protected-Audience: true` header.
- Fetches are uncredentialed.

Protected Audience has the browser pass in several “browserSignals” to the bidding script that give the script
unforgeable information about the context that the script is being executed in. This way bidders
and sellers have the choice to only participate in auctions where they are comfortable working with
the involved parties.

The [execution environment](#script-runners) available to these scripts is the absolute minimum necessary to calculate

a bid. It supports only ECMAScript. It does not support network, storage, timer, date, DOM,
Workers, postMessage, Navigator or Window APIs.

Protected Audience adds Permission-Policies to control access to the Protected Audience APIs to
give sites and embedders the ability to clamp down on use of the APIs as they see fit.
