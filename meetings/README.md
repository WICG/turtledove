> FLEDGE has been renamed to Protected Audience API. To learn more about the name change, see the [blog post](https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/protected-audience-api-our-new-name-for-fledge)

We are holding regular phone calls to resolve the details of the FLEDGE proposal.  These calls should be good places for a dedicated group to address open issues and suggest technical fixes, or to talk about particular use cases and how they can be met using FLEDGE.

Calls generally take place every second Wednesday, at 11am US Eastern time.  For call details see https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/88.

The minutes of each call are posted in this directory.
