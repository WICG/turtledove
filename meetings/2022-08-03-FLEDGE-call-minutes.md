## Notes


### TPAC
*   Michael Kleber: The W3C's annual TPAC meeting is happening in September in Vancouver: https://www.w3.org/2022/09/TPAC/  (requires registration, for both in-person and remote attendance).  We've requested some time for a joint session on FLEDGE and the parallel Microsoft PARAKEET proposal.  Keep your eyes on the schedule.
### Timeline update
*   Christina Ilvento: Since this group was last together, we've announced an update to the Privacy Sandbox timeline.
*   Rotem Dar: What is this extension to?  Origin Trial timeline, size, etc?
*   Christina: Mechanically, we're extending the Origin Trial timeline.  Its original expected end date was soon, but we want to give people more time to test Privacy Sandbox, so purely mechanically we are extending the length of the OT.  In the past the OT has also been restricted to Chrome Beta, but we are opening it up to a fraction of traffic on Chrome Stable also, so coming soon, testers should see a more general user base.  Third, we are adding more APIs and features.  For the first OT we made a bunch of relaxations to make things easier to test, but we will be tightening them up so that we bring the thing being tested closer to the thing we plan to launch — for example, aggregate reporting.  Also adding new APIs like Shared Storage, coming soon for testing.
*   David Dabbs: Could you note somewhere what the Shared Storage feature is, provide some links?  Sorry if I missed something, I'm just catching up.
*   Christina: This is a separate proposal, not part of FLEDGE.  GitHub repository for the proposal and further engagement: https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage

### Next Meeting
*   Michael: Still no topics on the agenda.  We should call this meeting, after 15min.  Should we have a meeting in two weeks?
*   Wendell Baker: Lower meeting density over the summer, and many hours of PATCG meeting next week.  Let's have future summer meetings only if there is a reason?
*   Michael: Agreed.  Next meeting will be in two weeks _if_ someone suggests an agenda topic, but we will cancel otherwise.
