# Announcements

Privacy Sandbox folks are holding every-second-Wednesday meetings in the hour after this meeting to discuss the trusted server elements of Protected Audience work. For more information see https://github.com/WICG/protected-auction-services-discussion/issues/27.

The Microsoft Edge folks are holding every-second-Thursday meetings at this same hour to discuss their very similar "Ad Selection API" work.  See https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/issues/50 for logistics.

Everyone is responsible for checking the accuracy of the notes doc, especially the part with their own comments - so go back later and make sure the notes are accurate.  You can even fix them on Github later!

Work is in progress, no timeline on when to expect it to launch.


## Happy Holidays everyone

Kleber apologizes for not cancelling this meeting in advance; New Year's resolution to do better at this when there is nothing on the agenda.

No meeting in one week (Christmas Day) or two weeks (New Years Day).

See you January 8.

 

Matt Davies: Thank you Michael and team for all your hard work!
